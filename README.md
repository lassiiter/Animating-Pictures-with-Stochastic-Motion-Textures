# Animating Pictures with Stochastic Motion Textures
Enhancing still pictures with subtly animated motion

## Implementation
This project implements Animating Pictures with Stochastic Motion Textures (2005) within this implementation includes (2004) Region Filling and Object Removal by
Exemplar-Based Image Inpainting and A Bayesian Approach to Digital Matting aswell as A Bayesian Approach to Digital Matting (2001). In this implementation youll find simplified implementations of these in order to have an appropriate output.
